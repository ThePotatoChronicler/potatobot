# Potatobot
My (yet again rewritten) Discord bot. Mostly for usage on
[my discord server](https://discord.gg/EWQPNfddmz), but you can
set it up yourself.

## Usage
```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Important environment variables
- DB_URL - MongoDB database URL
- DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN - The secret token to login, can be found on
your [Discord applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) panel
- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID - The discord application ID, can be
found on your [Discord applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) panel
